The Portfolio page is still a work in Progress. It started as a Free Code Camp project for the CSS/HTML section, and thus wasn't designed to run as anything more than a simple index.html.

The Portfolio page launches from Portfolio folder - index.html.

Trilogy is the only end to end project. Grid and Flexbox have # navs and design is a product of how many uses of a technique can be crammed on one page. Although, the design for Trilogy isn't much better - 70% Amazon book covers and 30% scrounge for free stuff ... but at least everything is very animated! LOL ... Hope you don't get motion sickness.  :-)

All the HTML CSS SCSS portions function within the Portfolio app/page, but the JavaScript projects are still static images ... but can be run individually with node

NOTE: The Front End Dev Challenge is really old - There are many things I would change about it today.
Per challenge specs - the dynamic content section was the only place JavaScript was permitted and responsive wasn't a requirement - If launched from the Portfolio page, only the CSS/HTML/JQuery portion will function (not dynamic content section)

EmoLocation is my first cringe worthy React Project.
