                    <h2>Step 1: Do research and create a “Documentation Plan</h2>
                    <br>
                    <article class="section-article">
                        <p>Every technical writing project starts with research. It might sound obvious, but knowing the purpose and scope of your technical documentation beforehand will save you a ton of time and energy (and headaches).<br> If you’re not
                            the subject matter expert, this might mean doing some internal interviews and building relationships with the technical team to get a stronger grasp on the material (and to avoid what senior technical writer Will Kelly calls
                            “Mission Impossible” technical writing projects). Or, it might be as simple as going through existing resources and guides and doing a short audit of what you have and what’s missing.<br> All of this information goes in what’s
                            called a documentation plan, a short outline to help guide you through the project. Here’s what you should include:</p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="doc_plan-li">
                                <h3>Goals:</h3>
                                <p>Simply put, what do you want people to be able to do? Is it to use your product? Find help documents quickly and easily? Learn how to use certain aspects of your tool? Let teammates request resources or order fulfillment?
                                    Having and knowing a clear goal is essential to writing good technical documentation and will help inform everything you do.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="doc_plan-li">
                                <h3>Existing resources:</h3>
                                <p>What’s currently out there? Are you updating or merging current resources or starting from scratch? Are there old, outdated versions that need to be killed? Do a quick audit and find anything and everything that will help
                                    you write or confuse your audience if they find it.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="doc_plan-li">
                                <h3>Style guides:</h3>
                                <p>Some industries require you to write technical documentation in a specific way (like the Plain Language guidelines for government sites or Simplified Technical English for aerospace, aviation, or defense companies). In
                                    other cases, your company might have a style guide that explains what language to use, how to talk to users, and even grammatical styles.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="doc_plan-li">
                                <h3>Outline of topics:</h3>
                                <p>What topics and subtopics will you be covering in your technical documentation? Think of this as a table of contents and try to list out every major section and subsection you think you’ll need.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="doc_plan-li">
                                <h3>Tools and management:</h3>
                                <p>What software, tools, or websites will be used to create and manage the documentation? Link to relevant style guides.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="doc_plan-li">
                                <h3>Deadline and final deliverables:</h3>
                                <p>When is it due and what format will it be in? Technical documentation is as much about structure and delivery as it is content. And knowing how the content will be presented before you start will tell you what you need
                                    and where to put your efforts.</p>
                            </li>

                        <h3>Start with a draft</h3>
                        <p>Using the information in your documentation plan, you can start to sketch out a high-level outline for each of the topics you’ll be covering. This is a great place to find holes in your planning and research as they’ll become painfully
                            obvious as you start to create an outline.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Use the 30/90 rule to get feedback</h3>
                        <p>At 30% done (your first draft or outline), you’re not asking for in-depth feedback or reviewing or typos and grammar, but rather for the reviewer to engage in the broader outline, flow, and structure of the document. While at 90%
                            done (your final draft), you’re asking them to go over the documentation with a fine-tooth comb and nit-pick any issues.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Get peer reviews and make revisions</h3>
                        <p>In between reviews from the SME you’ll also want to set up peer-review sessions to make sure the content is accessible and usable to your intended audience. Ask a project stakeholder or someone outside the project to go over your
                            documents and pick out anywhere they get lost or confused.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Edit, edit, and edit some more</h3>
                        <p>Good writing comes down to editing. With your feedback and revisions in place, break out your style guides and either edit the documentation yourself or take it to a technical editor who can make sure the language has a logical
                            flow and is consistent throughout.</p>

                    <article class="section-article">
                        <p>Once your documentation is put together and live, it’s time to get some real-world feedback on it. Unfortunately, this step often gets skipped during the development of technical documents (as most companies don’t have the time
                            and resources or think it’s not worth it). But, as we’ve said multiple times in this guide already, technical documentation is all about the user. If it doesn’t work for them, it’s a failure.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Start with a simple <b>safety check</b>. This means going through any documents, directions, or use cases that could potentially cause someone’s computer harm if done improperly. This could mean exposure of personal data, deleting
                            of important information, etc… You’ll know best based on your product.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>As part of the safety check, you should make sure to revisit the topics on basic functionality and terms explained as these are the core of your documents and should be precise.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Next, do a <b>navigation audit</b>. Remember that your document structure is key. If users can’t get around them easily they’re just as useless. Check for broken links and make sure navigational elements are working and obvious
                            (if you don’t have any, you’ll probably want to add some).</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Lastly, <b>check for usability/UX issues</b>. Are users getting lost or confused? Are they not getting the answers they were looking for (or thought they were getting based on headlines or navigation?) The experience for the user
                            comes down to more than just what you’ve written. Take the time to work with outside testers to make sure that when real users come to your documents, they leave happy.</p>
